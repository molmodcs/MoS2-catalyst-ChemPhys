The development of efficient technologies that enable the use of CO2 as a raw material for the synthesis of high-value-
added products is extremely important. Electrochemical methods are being considered promising to achieve this goal.
However, significant efforts still need to be made in developing more efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts. With the
aim of assisting in the planning of more efficient electrocatalysts, this work investigated, through DFT electronic struc-
ture calculations, the structure and properties of pure MoS2 and doped with various elements (Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co, Ti,
Nb, O, Se, Te), in addition to the S vacancy. The results obtained indicate that doping with Nb or Ti elements provides a
greater reduction in the work function of MoS2. Works found in the literature shows that there is a correlation between
the work function and current density. The lower the material’s work function, the higher the reaction current density
and the better the material’s performance as an electrocatalyst. Furthermore, the results indicate that the formation
energies of the COOH* and CHO* intermediates in MoS2 doped with Nb or Ti are more stable than those of the CO*
intermediate. The high stability of the binding energy of the CO* intermediate in relation to other intermediates rep-
resents a limitation for the catalytic efficiency of transition metal catalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 to products
with higher added value. These results are important and promising, since MoS2-based materials are used as catalysts
in several reactions, such as oxygen reduction, hydrodesulfurization and hydrogen evolution (HER)
